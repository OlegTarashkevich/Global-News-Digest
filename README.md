# Global-News-Digest

This is a demo app named Global News Digest.
I used MVP pattern, Dependency Injection with Dagger 2, request to https://newsapi.org API with Retrofit 2.2 and all working with RxJava.
For test purposes I added ability to change base url of API and added Mock server (it's working offline), so you able to change it in the settings of the app.
Created custom card views for Sources and Articles of news. Added ability to change sources of news.
